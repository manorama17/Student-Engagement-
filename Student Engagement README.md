# Problem Statement

Learn Data science is an e-learning platform specialized in offering high quality data science courses and tracks that would take you from a beginner to a qualified data scientist. Learn Data Science is a relatively new platform with alot of strong competitors in the same industry. In this project I’m trying to reveal useful data-driven information that would increase the engagement on the platform using EDA and by creating a dashboard.

# Questions

1. What percentage of students are active out of registered every month?
2. Top 5 countries with highest student registeration.
3. What is average watch time every month? Does it depend on marketing campaigns, promo periods, etc.?
4. Top 5 most watched courses.
5. What is the percentage of student’s engagement for exams, quizzes and lessons?
6. What KPIs are relevant to the problem?

# Findings

◉ Out of total registered students every month only 50% of them are actively
using the platform for either learning or taking quizzes or exams which means the engagement of students with the platform is pretty low.

◉ Most Registered Students are from India ie. 20% followed by US 13% and then Egypt with 8%.

◉ Average watch time was high in March, April, July, and August that's when marketing campaigns and promo periods were going on.

◉ Introduction to Data Science, SQL, Statistics, Excel and Python are top 5 most watched courses as majority of the students prefer to watch basic courses compared to advance.

◉ 98% of students are watching lessons.

◉ 35% of students have given quizzes rest 64% have not.

◉ Only 22% of students have taken exams.

# Recommendations

◉ Gamify the Platform(eg.Badges, Points, Levels and Leaderboards) so it can encourage the students to learn more and engage at the same time.

◉ A peer-to-peer learning discussion forum can address feelings of isolation, increase engagement and provide a valuable feedback at the same time for improving training processes and content.

◉ The next video lectures should only be unlocked once the quiz from the previous lecture is completed, since only 35% of students have given quizzes.

◉ Have a notification feature that will remind the students from time to time about the exam as only 22% of students have taken exam so far.
